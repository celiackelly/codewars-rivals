### Custom leaderboards to fuel the rivalries you really care about

I have a bit of an obsession with <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a>. And while I love the coding challenges...their social tools leave something to be desired. Why have three leaderboard tabs (allies, followers, and following) if you're going to show me the same 2,042 people in all of them? Why is my clan so huge that I can't find the five people I know in real life? 

Enter **Codewars Rivals.** Search for any Codewars user and add them to a custom leaderboard of your closest friends and bitterest rivals. Stats refresh on page load so you'll always know who's on top!
